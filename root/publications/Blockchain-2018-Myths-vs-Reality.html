				<p class="py-6">After a successful year of involvement in a variety of blockchain projects, I felt it
					healthy to take a step back and observe the emerging trends in this nascent (but still multi billion
					dollar) industry and question whether some of the directions taken so far are sensible or whether
					any corrections are necessary. I will provide a ‘snapshot’ of the state of advancement of the
					blockchain technology, describing the strengths and weaknesses of the solutions that have emerged so
					far, without proposing innovations at this stage (those ideas will form the subject of future blog
					posts). If you are interested to hear what I and Erlang Solutions, where I work as Scalability
					Architect and Technical Lead have to say about blockchain, let me take you through it:</p>
				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					The context
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">I do not propose in this blogpost to get into the details of the blockchain data
					structure itself, nor will I discuss what is the best Merkle tree solution to adopt. I will also
					avoid hot topics such as ‘Transactions Per Second’ (TPS) and the mechanisms for achieving
					substantial transaction volumes, which is de facto the ultimate benchmark widely adopted as a
					measurement of how competitive a solution is against the major players in the market; Bitcoin and
					Ethereum.

				</p>

				<p class="py-6">What I would like to examine instead is the state of maturity of the technology, and its
					alignment with the core principles that underpin the distributed ledger ecosystem. I hope that
					presenting a clear picture of these principles and how they are evolving may be helpful.</p>
				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					The principles
				</p>



				<p class="py-6">As the primary drive for innovation emerges from public, open source blockchains, this
					will be the one on which we will focus our attention.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">The blockchain technology mainly aims at embracing the following high level principles:

				</p>

				<ol class="list-decimal">
					<li>Immutability of the history</li>
					<li>Decentralisation of the control</li>
					<li>‘Workable’ consensus mechanism</li>
					<li>Distribution and resilience</li>
					<li>Transactional automation (including ‘smart contracts’)</li>
					<li>Transparency and Trust</li>
					<li>Link to the external world</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="py-6">Let us look at them one by one:</p>
				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					1. Immutability of the history
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">In an ideal world it would be desirable to preserve an accurate historical trace of
					events, and make sure this trace does not deteriorate over time, whether through natural events, or
					by human error or by the intervention of fraudulent actors. The artefacts produced in the analogue
					world face alterations over time, although there is often the intent to make sure they can withstand
					forces that threaten to alter and eventually destroy them. In the digital world the quantized /
					binary nature of the stored information provides the possibility of continuous corrections to
					prevent any deterioration that might occur over time.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Writing an immutable blockchain aims to retain a digital history that cannot be altered
					over time and on top of which one can verify that a trace of an event, known as a transaction, is
					recorded in it. This is particularly attractive when it comes to assessing the ownership or the
					authenticity of an asset or to validate one or more transactions.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">We should note that, on top of the inherent immutability of a well-designed and
					implemented blockchain, hashing algorithms also provide a means to encode the information that gets
					written in the history so that the capacity to verify a trace/transaction can only be performed by
					actors possessing sufficient data to compute the one-way1 cascaded encoding/encryption. This is
					typically implemented on top of Merkle trees where hashes of concatenated hashes are computed.


				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Legitimate questions can be raised about the guarantees for indefinitely storing an
					immutable data structure:


				</p>

				<ol class="list-decimal">
					<li>If this is an indefinitely growing history, where can it be stored once it grows beyond capacity
						of the ledgers?
					</li>
					<li>As the history size grows (and/or the computing power needed to validate further transactions
						increases) this reduces the number of potential participants in the ecosystem, leading to a de
						facto loss of decentralisation. At what point does this concentration of ‘power’ create
						concerns?
					</li>
					<li>How does the verification performance deteriorate as the history grows?
					</li>
					<li>How does it deteriorate when a lot of data gets written on it concurrently by the users?
					</li>
					<li>How long is the segment of data that you replicate on each ledger node?</li>
					<li>How much network traffic would such replication generate?</li>
					<li>How much history is needed to be able to compute a new transaction?</li>
					<li>What compromises need to be made on linearisation of the history, replication of the
						information, capacity to recover from anomalies and TPS throughput?
					</li>

				</ol>


				<p class="py-6">Further to the above questions we would also like to understand how many replicas
					converging to a specific history (i.e. consensus) would be needed for it to carry on existing, and
					in particular:
					<ol class="list-decimal">
						<li>Can a fragmented network carry on writing to their known history?

						</li>
						<li>Is an approach designed to ‘heal’ any discrepancies in the immutable history of transactions
							by rewarding the longest fork, fair and efficient?

						</li>
						<li>Are the deterrents strong enough to prevent a group of ledgers forming their own fork3 that
							eventually reaches a wider adoption?

						</li>


					</ol>

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Furthermore, a new requirement to comply with the General Data Protection Regulations
					(GDPR) in Europe and ‘the right to be forgotten’ introduced new challenges to the perspective of
					keeping permanent and immutable traces indefinitely. This is important because fines for breach of
					GDPR are potentially very significant. The solutions introduced so far effectively aim at
					anonymising the information that enters the immutable on-chain storage process, while sensitive
					information is stored separately in support databases where this information can be deleted if
					required. None of these approaches has yet been tested by the courts, nor has a definition of what
					the GDPR ‘right to be forgotten’ means in practice.


				</p>
				<p class="py-6">The challenging aspect here is to decide upfront what is considered sensitive and what
					can safely be placed on the immutable history. A wrong upfront choice can backfire at a later stage
					in the event that any involved actor manages to extract or trace sensitive information through the
					immutable history.


				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Immutability represents one of the fundamental principles that motivates the research
					into blockchain technology, both private and public. The solutions explored so far have managed to
					provide a satisfactory response to the market needs via the introduction of history linearisation
					techniques, one-way hashing encryptions, merkle trees and off-chain storage, although the linearity
					of the immutable history4 comes at a cost (notably transaction volume).

				</p>
				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					2. Decentralisation of the control
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">During the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis (one interpretation of which is
					that it highlighted the global financial disasters that could occur from over centralisation and the
					misalignment of economic incentives) there arose a deep mistrust of ‘traditional’, centralised
					institutions, political and commercial. One reaction against such centralisation was the exploration
					of various decentralised mechanisms which could replace those traditional, centralised structures.
					The proposition that individuals operating in a social context ideally would like to enjoy the
					freedom to be independent from a central authority gained in popularity. Self determination,
					democratic fairness and heterogeneity as a form of wealth are among the dominant values broadly
					recognised in Western (and, increasingly, non-Western) society. These values added weight to the
					movement that introducing decentralisation in a system is positive. I have rarely seen this very
					idea being challenged at all (in the same way one rarely hears criticism of the proposition that
					‘information wants to be free’), although in some circumstances the unwanted consequences of using
					this approach can clearly be seen.


				</p>
				<p class="py-6">For instance, one might argue that it is only due to our habits that we normally resolve
					anomalies in a system by contacting a central authority, which according to our implicit or explicit
					contractual terms, bears the responsibility for what happens to the system. Therefore, in the event
					of a damage incurred through a miscarried transaction that might be caused by a system failure or a
					fraudulent actor, we are typically inclined to contact the central bearer of the responsibility to
					intervene and try to resolve the damage sustained. Human history is characterised by the evolution
					of hierarchical power structures, even in the most ‘democratic’ of societies, and these hierarchies
					naturally create centralisation, independent of the dominant political structure in any particular
					society. This characteristic continues into the early 21st century.


				</p>
				<p class="py-6">With decentralisation, however, there is no such central authority that could resolve
					those issues for us. Traditional, centralised systems have well developed anti-fraud and asset
					recovery mechanisms which people have become used to. Using new, decentralised technology places a
					far greater responsibility on the user if they are to receive all of the benefits of the technology,
					forcing them to take additional precautions when it comes to handling and storing their digital
					assets. In particular they need to keep the access to their digital wallets protected and make sure
					they don’t lose it. Similarly when performing transactions, such as giving away a digital asset to a
					friend or a relative, they have to make sure it is sent to the right address/wallet, otherwise it
					will be effectively lost or mistakenly handed over to someone else.


				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Also, there’s no point having an ultra-secure blockchain if one then hands over one’s
					wallet private key to an intermediary (more ‘centralisation’ again) whose security is lax: it’s like
					having the most secure safe in the world then writing the combination on a whiteboard in the same
					room.


				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Is the increased level of personal responsibility that goes with the proper
					implementation of a secure blockchain a price that users are willing to pay; or will they trade off
					some security in exchange for ease of use (and, by definition, more centralisation)? It’s too early
					to see how this might pan out. If people are willing to make compromises here, what other
					compromises re, say, security or centralisation would they be prepared to accept in exchange for
					lower cost/ease of use? We don’t know, as there’s no secure blockchain ecosystem yet operating at
					scale.


				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Another threat to the broad endorsement and success of the decentralisation principle is
					posed by governmental regulatory/legal pressures on digital assets and ecosystems. This is to ensure
					that individuals do not use the blockchain for tax evasion and that the ownership of their digital
					assets is somehow protected. However any attempt to regulate this market from a central point is
					undermining the effort to promote the adoption of a decentralised form of authority.


				</p>
				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					3. Consensus
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">The consistent push towards decentralised forms of control and responsibility has
					brought to light the fundamental requirement to validate transactions without the need for (or
					intervention of) a central authority; this is known as the ‘consensus’ problem and a number of
					approaches have grown out of the blockchain industry, some competing and some complementary.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">There has also been a significant focus around the concept of governance within a
					blockchain ecosystem. This concerns the need to regulate the rates at which new blocks are added to
					the chain and the associated rewards for miners (in the case of blockchains using proof of work
					(POW) consensus methodologies). More generally, it is important to create incentives and deterrent
					mechanisms whereby interested actors contribute positively to the healthy continuation of the chain
					growth.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Besides serving as economic deterrent against denial of service and spam attacks, POW
					approaches are amongst the first attempts to automatically work out, via the use of computational
					power, which ledgers/actors have the authority to create/mine new blocks5. Other similar approaches
					(proof of space, proof of bandwidth etc) followed, however, they all suffered from exposure to
					deviations from the intended fair distribution of control. Wealthy participants can in fact exploit
					these approaches to gain an advantage via purchasing high performance (CPU / memory / network
					bandwidth) dedicated hardware in large quantity and operating it in jurisdictions where electricity
					is relatively cheap. This results in overtaking the competition to obtain the reward, and the
					authority to mine new blocks, which has the inherent effect of centralising the control. Also the
					huge energy consumption that comes with the inefficient nature of the competitive race to mine new
					blocks in POW consensus mechanisms has raised concerns about its environmental impact and economic
					sustainability. The most recent report on the energy usage of Bitcoin can be seen here on
					digiconomist.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Proof of Stake (POS) and Proof of Importance (POI) are among the ideas introduced to
					drive consensus via the use of more social parameters, rather than computing resources. These two
					approaches link the authority to the accumulated digital asset/currency wealth or the measured
					productivity of the involved participants. Implementing POS and POI mechanisms, whilst guarding
					against the concentration of power/wealth, poses not insubstantial challenges for their architects
					and developers.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">More recently, semi-automatic approaches, driven by a human-curated group of ledgers,
					are putting in place solutions to overcome the limitations and arguable fairness of the above
					strategies. The Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) and Proof of Authority (POA) methods promise higher
					throughput and lower energy consumptions, while the human element can ensure a more adaptive and
					flexible response to potential deviations caused by malicious actors attempting to exploit a
					vulnerability of the system.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Whether these solutions actually manage to fulfill the inherent requirements, set by the
					principle of control distribution, is debatable. Similarly, when it comes to the idea of bringing in
					another layer of human driven consensus for the curation, it is clear that we are abandoning a
					degree of automation. Valuing trust and reputation in the way authority gets exercised on the
					governance of a particular blockchain appears to bring back a form of centralised control, which
					clearly goes against the original intention and the blockchain ethos.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">This appears to be one of the areas where, despite the initial enthusiasm, there is not
					yet a clear solution that drives consensus in a fair, sustainable and automated manner. Moving
					forward I expect this to be the main research focus for the players in the industry, as current
					solutions leave many observers unimpressed. There will likely emerge a number of differing
					approaches, each suitable for particular classes of use case.

				</p>


				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					4. Distribution and resilience </p>
				<p class="py-6">Apart from decentralising the authority, control and governance, blockchain solutions
					typically embrace a distributed Peer to Peer (P2P) design paradigm. This preference is motivated by
					the inherent resilience and flexibility that these types of networks have introduced and
					demonstrated, particularly in the context of file and data sharing (see a brief p2p history here).
					The diagram below is frequently used to explain the difference among three network topologies:
					centralised, decentralised and distributed.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">A centralised network, typical of mainframes and centralised services6, is clearly
					exposed to a ‘single point of failure’ vulnerability as the operations are always routed towards a
					central node. In the event that the central node breaks down or is congested, all the other nodes
					will be affected by disruptions.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Decentralised and distributed networks attempt to reduce the detrimental effects that
					issues occurring on a node might trigger on other nodes. In a decentralised network, the failure of
					a node can still affect several neighbouring nodes that rely on it to carry out their operations. In
					a distributed network the idea is that failure of a single node should not impact significantly any
					other node. In fact, even when one preferential/optimal route in the network becomes congested or
					breaks down entirely, a message can reach the destination via an alternative route. This greatly
					increases the chances to keep a service available in the event of failure or malicious attacks such
					as a denial of service (DOS) attack.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Blockchain networks where a distributed topology is combined with a high redundancy of
					ledgers backing a history have occasionally been declared “unhackable” by enthusiasts or, as some
					more prudent debaters say, “difficult to hack”. There is truth in this, especially when it comes to
					very large networks such as Bitcoin (see an additional explanation here). In such a highly
					distributed network, the resources needed to generate a significant disruption are very high, which
					not only delivers on the resilience requirement, but also works as a deterrent against malicious
					attacks (principally because the cost of conducting a successful malicious attack becomes
					prohibitive).



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Although a distributed topology can provide an effective response to failures or traffic
					spikes, we need to be aware that delivering resilience against prolonged over-capacity demands or
					malicious attacks requires adequate adapting mechanisms. While the Bitcoin network is well
					positioned, as it currently benefits from a high capacity condition (due to the historical high
					incentive to purchase hardware by third party miners7 ), this is not the case for other emerging
					networks as they grow in popularity. This is where novel instruments, capable of delivering
					preemptive adaptation combined with back pressure throttling applied to the P2P level, can be of
					great value.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Distributed systems are not new and, whilst they provide highly robust solutions to many
					enterprises and governmental problems, they are subject to the laws of physics and require their
					architects to consider the trade-offs that need to be made in their design and implementation (e.g.
					consistency vs availability). This remains the case for blockchain systems.


				</p>
				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					5. Automation

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">In order to sustain a coherent, fair and consistent blockchain and its surrounding
					ecosystem a high degree of automation is required. Existing areas with a high demand of automation
					include those common to most distributed systems. For instance; deployment, elastic topologies,
					monitoring, recovery from anomalies, testing, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. In
					the context of blockchains, these represent well-established IT engineering practices. Additionally,
					there is a creative R&D effort to automate the interactions required to handle assets, computational
					resources and users across a range of new problem spaces (e.g. logistics, digital asset creation and
					trading etc).



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">The trend of social interactions has seen a significant shift towards scripting for
					transactional operations. This is where ‘Smart Contracts’ and constrained virtual machines (VM)
					interpreters have emerged - an effort pioneered by the Ethereum project.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">The possibility to define through scripting how to operate an asset exchange, under what
					conditions and actioned by which triggers, has attracted many blockchain enthusiasts. Some of the
					most common applications of Smart Contracts involve lotteries, trade of digital assets and
					derivative trading. While there is clearly an exciting potential unleashed by the introduction of
					Smart Contracts, it is also true that it is still an area with a high entry barrier. Only skilled
					developers that are willing to invest time in learning Domain Specific Languages (DSL)8 have access
					to the actual creation and modification of these contracts.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Besides, developers can create contracts that contain errors or are incapable to operate
					under unexpected conditions. This can happen, for instance, when the implementation of a contract is
					commissioned to a developer that does not have sufficient domain knowledge. Although the industry is
					taking steps in the right direction, there is still a long way to go in order to automatically adapt
					to unforeseen conditions and create effective Smart Contracts in non-trivial use cases. The
					challenge is to respond to safety and security concerns when Smart Contracts are applied to edge
					case scenarios that deviate from the ‘happy path’. If badly-designed contracts cannot properly
					rollback/undo a miscarried transaction, their execution might lead to assets being lost or
					erroneously handed over to unwanted receivers. A number of organisations are conducting R&D effort
					to respond to these known issues and introduce VMs operating under more restrictive constraints to
					deliver a higher level of safety and security. However, from a conceptual perspective, this is a
					restriction that reduces the flexibility to implement specific needs.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Another area in high need for automation is governance. Any blockchain ecosystem of
					users and computing resources requires periodic configurations of the parameters to carry on
					operating coherently and consensually. This results in a complex exercise of tuning for incentives
					and deterrents to guarantee the fulfilment of ambitious collaborative and decentralised goals. The
					newly emerging field of ‘blockchain economics’ (combining economics; game theory; social science and
					other disciplines) remains in its infancy.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Clearly the removal of a central ruling authority produces a vacuum that needs to be
					filled by an adequate decision making body, which is typically supplied with an automation that
					maintains a combination of static and dynamic configuration settings. Those consensus solutions
					referred to earlier which use computational resources or social stackable assets to assign the
					authority, not only to produce blocks but also to steer the variable part of governance9, have
					originally succeeded to fill the decision making gap in a fair and automated way. Successively, the
					exploitation of flaws in the static element of governance has hindered the success of these models.
					This has contributed to the rise of popularity of curated approaches such as POA or DPOS, which not
					only bring back a centralised control, but also reduce the automation of governance.


				</p>
				<p class="py-6">I expect this to be one of the major area where blockchain has to evolve in order to
					succeed in getting a widespread market adoption.



				</p>

				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					6. Transparency and Trust
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">In order to produce the desired audience engagement for a blockchain and eventually
					determine its mass adoption and success, its consensus and governance mechanisms need to operate
					transparently. Users need to know who has access to what data, so that they can decide what can be
					stored and possibly shared on-chain. These are the contractual terms by which users agree to share
					their data. As previously discussed users might require to exercise the right for their data to be
					deleted, which typically is a feature delivered via auxiliary, ‘off-chain’ databases. In contrast,
					only hashed information, effectively devoid of its meaning, is preserved permanently on-chain.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Given the immutable nature of the chain history, it is important to decide upfront what
					data should be permanently written on-chain and what gets written off-chain. The users should be
					made aware of what data gets stored on-chain and with whom it could potentially be shared. Changing
					access to on-chain data or deleting it goes against the fundamentals of the immutability and
					therefore is almost impossible. Getting that decision wrong at the outset can significantly affect
					the cost and usability (and therefore likely adoption) of the blockchain in question.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Besides transparency, trust is another critical feature that users legitimately seek.
					This is one of the reasons why blockchain manages to attract customers who have developed distrust
					in traditional centrally-ruled networks (most notably banks and rating organisations after the
					mishandling of the subprime mortgages that led to the 2008 financial crisis). It is vital,
					therefore, that central operating bodies in the shape of curated POA/DPOS consensus act in a
					transparent and trustworthy manner, so that decision makers are not perceived as an elite that could
					pursue their own goals, instead of operating in the interest of the collective.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Another example of trust towards the people involved becomes relevant when the
					blockchain information is linked to the real world. As it will be clarified in the context of the
					next principle (see heading 7), this link involves people and technology dedicated to guarantee the
					accurate preservation of these links against environmental deterioration or fraudulent misuse.



				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Trust also has to go beyond the scope of the people involved as systems need to be
					trusted as well. Every static element, such as an encryption algorithm, the dependency on a library,
					or an fixed configuration, is potentially exposed to vulnerabilities. Concerns here are
					understandable given the increasing amount of well-publicised hacks and security breaches that have
					occurred over the last couple of years. In the cryptocurrency space, these attacks have frequently
					resulted in the perpetrators successfully walking away with large sums of money, without leaving
					traces that could be realistically used to track down their identity, or rollback to a previous
					healthy state. In the non-crypto space they have resulted in widespread hacks of data and the
					disabling of corporate and civil IT systems.

				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					7. Link to the external world
				</p>

				<p class="py-6">The attractive features that blockchain has brought to the internet market would be
					limited to handling digital assets, unless there was a way to link informations to the real world.
					For some reason this brings back to my mind the popular movie “The Matrix” and the philosophical
					question from René Descartes about what is real and if there is another reality behind the perceived
					one. Without indulging excessively in arguable analogies, it is safe to say that there would be less
					interest if we were to accept that a blockchain can only operate under the restrictive boundaries of
					the digital world, without connecting to the analog real world in which we live.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Technologies used to overcome these limitations include cyber-physical devices such as
					sensors for input and robotic activators for output, and in most circumstances, people and
					organisations. As we read through most blockchain whitepapers we might occasionally come across the
					notion of the oracle, which in short, is a way to name an input coming from a trusted external
					source that could potentially trigger/activate a sequence of transactions in a Smart Contract or
					which can otherwise be used to validate some information that cannot be validated within the
					blockchain itself.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Under the Transparency and Trust section we discussed how these peripheral areas are as
					susceptible to errors and malicious interference as the core blockchain and Smart Contracts
					automations. For instance, suppose we are tracking the history of a precious collectible item,
					unless we have the capacity to identify reliably the physical object in question we risk that its
					history is lost or attributed to another object.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">A remarkable example of object identification approach via physical characteristics is
					the one used by Everledger to track diamonds. As briefly explained, 40 metadata information can be
					extracted from the object, including the cut, the clarity, the colour, etc. Given the
					quasi-immutable nature of the objects in question, this has proved a particularly successful use
					case. It is more challenging instead to accurately identify objects that degrade over time (e.g.
					fine art). In this case typically trusted people are involved, or a combination of people and sensor
					metadata. Relying on expert actors to provide external validation relies upon a properly aligned set
					of incentives. ‘Traditional’ industries have a long history of dealing with these issues and
					well-developed mechanisms for dealing with them: blockchain-based solutions are exploring many ways
					in which they can interface (and adapt) these existing mechanisms.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">On a different perspective even wealth itself only makes sense if it can be exercised in
					the ‘real world’. This is as valid for blockchain as well as traditional centrally-controlled
					systems, and in fact the idea of virtualising wealth is not new to us as we shifted from trading
					time and goods directly, to stacking wealth into account deposits. What’s new in this respect is the
					introduction of alternate currencies known as cryptocurrencies.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two dominant projects (in September 2018) in the blockchain
					space are by many investors seen as an opportunity to diversify a portfolio or speculate on the
					value of their respective cryptocurrency. The same applies to a wide range of other cryptocurrencies
					with the exception of fiat pegged currencies, most notably Tether, where the value is effectively
					bound to the US dollar. Conversions from one cryptocurrency to another and to/from fiat currencies
					is typically operated by exchanges on behalf of an investor. These are again peripheral services
					that serve as link to the external world.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">From a blockchain perspective, some argue that the risk control a cryptocurrency
					investor demands - so that there is the possibility to step back and convert back to fiat currencies
					- is the wrong mindset. Evangelising trust towards the cryptocurrency diversification however,
					understandably, requires an implementation period during which investors legitimately might want to
					exercise the option to pull-out.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Besides oracles and cyber-physical links, an interest is emerging with linking Smart
					Contracts together to deliver a comprehensive solution. Contracts could indeed operate in a
					cross-chain scenario to offer interoperability among a variety of digital assets and protocols.
					Although attempts to combine different protocols and approaches have emerged (e.g. see the EEA and
					the Accord Project), this is still an area where further R&D is necessary in order to provide enough
					instruments and guarantees to developers and entrepreneurs. The challenge is to deliver cross-chain
					functionalities without the support of a central governing agency/body.

				</p>

				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					Conclusion
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">The financial boost that the blockchain market has benefited from, through the large
					fundraise operations conducted through the 2017-2018 initial coin offerings (ICO), has given the
					opportunity to conduct a substantial amount of R&D studies aimed at finding solutions to the
					challenges described in this blogpost. Although step changes have been introduced by the work of
					visionary individuals with mathematical backgrounds such as S. Nakamoto and V. Buterin, it seems
					clear that contributions need to come from a variety of expertises to ensure a successful
					development of the technology and the surrounding ecosystem. It is an exercise that involves
					evangelisation, social psychology, automation, regulatory compliance and ethical direction.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">The challenges the market is facing can be interpreted as an opportunity for ambitious
					entrepreneurs to step in and resolve the pending fundamental issues of consensus, governance,
					automation and link to the real world. It is important in this sense to ensure that the people you
					work with have the competence, the technology and a good understanding of the issues to be resolved,
					in order to successfully drive this research forward (see Erlang Solutions offering here).

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">As discussed in the introduction, this blogpost only focuses on assessing the state of
					advancement of the technology in response to the motivating principles, and analyses known issues
					without proposing solutions. That said, I and the people I work with, are actively working on
					solutions that will be presented and discussed in a separate forum. If you are interested to learn
					more, stay tuned for the next chapter :-) ..
