					Introduction
				</p>

				<p class="py-6">Seven months of intense activity have passed since the release of Blockchain 2018 Myth
					vs. Reality article. As a follow-up to that blog post, I would like to take the opportunity to
					analyse in further detail the impact that this new technology has on our perceptions of asset
					ownership and value, how we are continuously exploring new forms of transactional automation and
					then conclude with the challenge to deliver safe and fair governance.</p>

				<p class="py-6">Since the topic to cover is vast, I have decided to divide it into two separate blog
					posts, the first of which will cover how the meaning and perception of ownership is changing, while
					the second will discuss how Smart Contract automation can help deliver safe, fair, fast, low-cost,
					transparent and auditable transactional interoperability.</p>

				<p class="py-6">My intention is to provide an abstract and accessible summary that describes the
					state-of-the-art of blockchain technology and what motivations have led us to the current
					development stage. While these posts will not focus on future innovation, they will serve as a
					prelude to more bold publications I intend to release in the future.</p>



				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					Digital Asset Ownership, Provenance and Handling <br>
					How we value Digital vs. Physical Assets
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">In order to understand how the notion of ownership is currently perceived in society, I
					propose to briefly analyse the journey that has brought us to the present stage and the factors
					which have contributed to the evolution of our perceptions. </p>
				<p class="py-6">Historically people have been predominantly inclined to own and trade physical objects.
					This is probably best explained by the fact that physical objects stimulate our senses and donâ€™t
					require the capacity to abstract, as opposed to services for instance. Ownership was usually
					synonymous with possession.</p>
				<p class="py-6">Let us try to break down and extract the fundamentals of the economy of physical goods:
					we originally came to this world and nothing was owned by anyone; possession by individuals then
					gave rise to ownership â€˜rightsâ€™ (obtained through the expenditure of labour - finding or creating
					possessions); later we formed organisations that exercised territorial control and supported the
					notion of ownership (via norms and mores that evolved into legal frameworks), as a form of
					protection of physical goods. Land and raw materials are the building blocks of this aspect of our
					economy.</p>
				<p class="py-6">When we trade (buy or sell) commodities or other physical goods, what we own is a
					combination of the raw material, which comes with a limited supply, plus the human/machine work
					required to transform it to make it ready to be used and/or consumed. Value was historically based
					on a combination of the inherent worth of the resource (scarcity being a proxy) plus the cost of the
					work required to transform that resource into an asset. Special asset classes (e.g. art) soon
					emerged where value was related to intangible factors such as provenance, fashion, skill (as opposed
					to the quantum of labour) etc.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">We can observe that even physical goods contain an abstract element: the design, the
					capacity to model it, package it and make it appealing to the owners or consumers.
					s </p>
				<p class="py-6">In comparison, digital assets have a stronger element of abstraction which defines their
					value, while their physical element is often negligible and replaceable (e.g. software can be stored
					on disk, transferred or printed). These types of assets typically stimulate our intellect and
					imagination, as our senses get activated via a form of rendering which can be visual, acoustic or
					tactile. Documents, paintings, photos, sculptures and music notations have historical equivalents
					that predate any form of electrically-based analog or digital representations.
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">The peculiarity of digital goods is that they can be copied exactly at very low cost:
					for example, they can be easily reproduced in multiple representations on heterogeneous physical
					platforms or substrates thanks to the discrete nature in which we store them (using a simplified
					binary format). The perceivable form can be reconstructed and derived from these equal
					representations an infinite number of times. This is a feature that dramatically influences how we
					value digital assets. The opportunity to create replicas implies that it is not the copy nor the
					rendering that should be valued, but rather the original digital work. In fact, this is one of the
					primary achievements that blockchain has introduced via the hash lock inherent to its data
					structure.
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">If used correctly the capacity to clone a digital item can increase confidence that it
					will exist indefinitely and therefore maintain its value. However, as mentioned in my previous blog
					post (Blockchain 2018 - Myth vs. Reality) the immutability and perpetual existence of digital goods
					are not immune from facing destruction, as at present there is a dependence on a physical medium
					(e.g. hard disk storage) that is potentially subject to alteration, degradation or obsolescence.
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">A blockchain, such as that of the Bitcoin network, represents a model for vast
					replication and reinforcement of digital information via so-called Distributed Ledger Technology
					(DLT). Repair mechanisms can intervene in order to restore integrity in the event that data gets
					corrupted by a degrading physical support (i.e. a hard disk failure) or a malicious actor. The
					validity of data is agreed upon by a majority (the level of majority varying across different DLT
					implementations) of peer-to-peer actors (ledgers) through a process known as consensus.
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">This is a step in the right direction, although the exploration of increasingly advanced
					platforms to preserve digital assets is expected to evolve further. As genetic evolution suggests,
					clones with equal characteristics can all face extinction by the introduction of an actor that makes
					the environment unfit for survival in a particular form. Thus, it might be sensible to introduce
					heterogeneous types of ledgers to ensure their continued preservation on a variety of physical
					platforms and therefore enhance the likelihood of survival of information.
				</p>
				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					The evolution of services and their automation
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">In the previous paragraph, we briefly introduced a distinction between physical assets
					and goods where the abstraction element is dominant. Here I propose to analyse how we have started
					to attach value to services and how we are becoming increasingly demanding about their performance
					and quality.
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Services are a form of abstract valuable commonly traded on the market. They represent
					the actions bound to the contractual terms under which a transformation takes place. This
					transformation can apply to physical goods, digital assets, other services themselves or to
					individuals. What we trade, in this case, is the potential to exercise a transformation, which in
					some circumstances might have been applied already. For instance, a transformed commodity, such as
					refined oil, has already undergone a transformation from its original raw form.
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Another example is an artefact where a particular shape can either be of use or trigger
					emotional responses, such as artefacts with artistic value. Service transformation in the art world
					can be highly individualistic (depending on the identity of the person doing the transforming (the
					artist; the critic; the gallery etc) or the audience for the transformed work. Thus, Duchampâ€™s
					elevation (or, possibly, degradation) of a porcelain urinal to artwork relied on a number of
					connected elements (i.e. transformational actions by actors in the art world and beyond) for the
					transformation to be successful - these elements are often only recognised and/or understood after
					the transformation has been affected.
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Even the rendering from an abstract form, such as with music notation or a record, the
					actual sound is a type of transformation that we consider valuable and commonly trade. These
					transformations can be performed by humans or machinery. With the surge of interest in digital
					goods, there is a corresponding increasing interest in acquiring services to transform them.
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">As these transformations are being automated more and more, and the human element is
					progressively being removed, even services are gradually taking the shape of automated algorithms
					that are yet another form of digital asset, as is the case with Smart Contracts. Note, however, that
					in order to apply the transformation, an algorithm is not enough, we need an executor such as a
					physical or virtual machine.
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">In Part 2 we will analyse how the automation of services has led to the evolution of
					Smart Contracts, as a way to deliver efficient, transparent and traceable transformations.
				</p>
				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					Sustainability and Access to resources
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Intellectual and imagination stimulation is not the only motivator that explains the
					increasing interest in digital goods and consequently their rising market value. Physical goods are
					known to be quite costly to handle. In order to create, trade, own and preserve them there is a
					significant expenditure required for storage, transport, insurance, maintenance, extraction of raw
					materials etc.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">There is a competitive and environmental cost involved, which makes access to physical
					resources inherently non-scalable and occasionally prohibitive, especially in concentrated urban
					areas. As a result, people are incentivised to own and trade digital goods and services, which turns
					out to be a more sustainable way forward.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">For example, let us think about an artist who lives in a densely populated city and
					needs to acquire a canvas, paint, brushes, and so on, plus studio and storage space in order to
					create a painting. Finding that these resources are difficult or impossible to access, he/she
					decides to produce their artwork in a digital form.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Services traditionally require resources to be delivered (e.g. raw material processing).
					However, a subset of these (such as those requiring non-physical effort, for instance, stock market
					trading, legal or accounting services) are ideally suited to being carried out at a significantly
					lower cost via the application of algorithmic automations.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Note: this analysis assumes that the high carbon footprint required to drive the â€˜Proof
					of Workâ€™ consensus mechanism used in many DLT ecosystems can be avoided, otherwise the
					sustainability advantage can be legitimately debated.

				</p>
				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					The Generative Approach
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">The affordable access to digital resources, combined with the creation of consistently
					innovative algorithms has also contributed to the rise of a generative production of digital assets.
					These include partial generation, typically obtained by combining and assembling pre-made parts:
					e.g. Robohash derives a hash from a text added to the URL that leads to a fixed combination of
					mouths, eyes, faces, body and accessories.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Other approaches involve Neural Net Deep Learning: e.g. ThisPersonDoesNotExist uses a
					technology known as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) released by NVidia Research Labs to
					generate random people faces, Magenta uses a Google TensorFlow library to generate Music and Art,
					while DeepArt uses a patented neural net implementation based on the 19-layer VGG network.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">In the gaming industry we should mention No Manâ€™s Sky, a mainstream Console and PC Game
					that shows a successful use of procedural generation.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Project DreamCatcher also uses a generative design approach that leverages a wide set of
					simulated solutions that respond to a set of predefined requirements that a material or shape should
					satisfy.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">When it comes to Generative Art, it is important to ensure scarcity by restricting the
					creation of digital assets to limited editions, so an auto-generated item can be traded without the
					danger that an excess of supply triggers deflationary repercussions on its price. In Blockchain 2019
					Part 2 we will describe techniques to register Non Fungible Tokens (NFT) on the blockchain in order
					to track each individual replica of an object while ensuring that there are no illegal ones.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Interesting approaches directly linked to Blockchain Technology have been launched
					recently such as the AutoGlyphs from LarvaLabs, although this remains an open area for further
					exploration. Remarkably successful is the case of Obvious Art where another application of the GAN
					approach resulted in a Generated Artwork being auctioned off for $432,500.

				</p>
				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					What prevents mass adoption of digital goods
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Whereas it is sensible to forecast a significant expansion of the digital assets market
					in the coming years, it is also true that, at present, there are still several psychological
					barriers to overcome in order to get broader traction in the market.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">The primary challenge relates to trust. A purchaser wants some guarantees that traded
					assets are genuine and that the seller owns them or acts on behalf of the owner. DLT provides a
					solid way to work out the history of a registered item without interrogating a centralised trusted
					entity. Provenance and ownership are inferable and verifiable from a number of replicated ledgers
					while block sequences can help ensure there is no double spending or double sale taking place within
					a certain time frame.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">The second challenge is linked to the meaning of ownership outside of the context of a
					specific market. I would like to cite as an example the closure of Microsoftâ€™s eBook store.
					Microsoftâ€™s decision to pull out of the ebook market, presumably motivated by a lack of profit,
					could have an impact on all ebook purchases that were made on that platform. The perception of the
					customer was obviously that owning an ebook was the same as owning a physical book. What Microsoft
					might have contractually agreed through its End-User License Agreement (EULA), however, is that this
					is true only within the contextual existence of its platform.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">This has also happened in video games where enthusiast players are perceiving the
					acquisition of a sword, or armour as if they were real objects. Even without the game closing down
					its online presence (e.g. when its maintenance costs become unsustainable), a lack of interest or
					reduced popularity might result in a digital item losing its value.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">There is a push, in this sense, towards forms of ownership that can break out from the
					restrictions of a specific market and be maintained in a broader context. Blockchainâ€™s DLT in
					conjunction with Smart Contracts, that exist potentially indefinitely, can be used to serve this
					purpose allowing people to effectively retain their digital itemsâ€™ use across multiple applications.
					Whether those items will have a utility or value outside the context and platform in/on which they
					were originally created remains to be seen.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Even the acquisition of digital art requires a substantial paradigm shift. Compared to
					what happens with physical artefacts, there is not an equivalent tangible sense of taking home (or
					to oneâ€™s secure storage vault) a purchased object. This has been substituted by a verifiable trace
					on a distributed ledger that indicates to whom a registered digital object belongs.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Sensorial forms can also help in adapting to this new form of ownership. For instance, a
					digital work of art could be printed, a 3D model could be rendered for a VR or AR experience or 3D
					printed. In fact, to control what you can do with a digital item is per se a form of partial
					ownership, which can be traded. This is different from the concept of fractional ownership where
					your ownership comes in a general but diluted form. It is more a functional type of ownership. This
					is a concept which exists in relation to certain traditional, non-digital assets, often bounded by
					national laws and the physical form of those assets. For instance, I can own a classic Ferrari and
					allow someone else to race it; I can display it in my museum and charge an entry fee to visitors;
					but I will be restricted in how I am permitted to use the Ferrari name and badge attached to that
					vehicle.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">The transition to these new notions of ownership is particularly demanding when it comes
					to digital non-fungible assets. Meanwhile, embracing fungible assets, such as a cryptocurrency, has
					been somewhat easier for customers who are already used to relating to financial instruments. This
					is probably because fungible assets serve the unique function of paying for something, while in the
					case of non-fungible assets there is a range of functions that define their meaning in the digital
					or physical space.

				</p>
				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					Conclusion
				</p>
				<p class="py-6">In this post we have discussed a major emerging innovation that blockchain technology
					has influenced dramatically over the last two years - the ownership of digital assets. In Blockchain
					2019 - Part 2 we will expand on how the handling of assets gets automated via increasingly powerful
					Smart Contracts.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">What we are witnessing is a new era that is likely to revolutionise the perception of
					ownership and reliance on trusted and trustless forms of automation. This is driven by the need to
					increase interoperability, cost compression, sustainability, performance (as in the speed at which
					events occur) and customisation, which are all aspects where traditional centralised fintech systems
					have not given a sufficient solution. It is worthwhile, however, to remind ourselves that the
					journey towards providing a response to these requirements, should not come at the expense of safety
					and security.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">Privacy and sharing are also areas heavily debated. Owners of digital assets often
					prefer their identity to remain anonymous, while the benefit of socially shared information is
					widely recognised. An art collector, for instance, might not want to disclose his or her personal
					identity. Certainly, a lot more still remains to be explored as we are clearly just at the beginning
					of a wider journey that is going to reshape global digital and physical markets.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">At Erlang Solutions we are collaborating with partners in researching innovative and
					performant services to support a wide range of clients. This ranges from building core blockchain
					technologies to more specific distributed applications supported by Smart Contracts. Part of this
					effort has been shared on our website where you can find some information on who we work with in the
					fintech world and some interesting case studies, others of which remain under the scope of NDAs.

				</p>
				<p class="py-6">This post intentionally aims at providing a state-of-the-art analysis. We soon expect to
					be in a position to release more specific and, possibly controversial, articles where a bolder
					vision will be illustrated. Get notifications when more content gets published - you know the drill,
